<h3>WHO Health Alert for coronavirus launches on WhatsApp</h3> 
<p>
<h5>
To increase access to reliable information, WHO worked with WhatsApp and Facebook to launch a new WHO Health Alert messaging service today. The <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=d97cb6dd_2">WhatsApp-based service </a>will provide vital information about COVID-19 to millions of people through their mobile phones. The services uses an AI chatbot to provide updated information on the pandemic, including how to protect yourself, questions and answers, and the latest news and press coverage. The Health Alert service is now available in English and will be introduced in other languages next week. This is part of WHO's wider initiative to work with technology companies to get <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">accurate health information</a> into the hands of people that need it at this critical time</h5></p>
